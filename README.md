# Aimt

Aimt is an array index mapping tool used to interconvert between index and subscripts. This open-source project is written in C language and operates by performing multidimensional conversions. As the [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/) and [Octave Forge](https://octave.sourceforge.io/), there are two functions responsible for mapping array indexes: the sub2ind and ind2sub.
